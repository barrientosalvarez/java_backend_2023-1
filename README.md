# Assignment #4: Repository generation with JPA.

Based on the development of assignment 3, do the following:

* Create the category service and repository with the necessary methods to implement the functionality required

by the endpoints.

* Update the category driver from the previous assignment so that the endpoints respond as specified in the 

endpoint document, i.e., no longer have present example data and use the methods implemented in the category service.
