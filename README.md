* Add exception handling implementation. The following classes must be implemented:
    * ExceptionResponse
    * ApiException
    * ExceptionHandler
    * ApiResponse

* Update the returning objects in the signatures of the Service Category methods, so that the methods that require

it  will respond with an ApiResponde instead of a String.

according to the endpoints category format.

* Finally, the Category ServiceImp must also be updated so that it also gives successful

and unsuccesful responses according to the endpoint format.
