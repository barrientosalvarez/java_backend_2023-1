## Execution.
In ordet to have an easy execution, you will find two script files: first_run.sh and run.sh . If it is the first time you are going

to execute this code, you need to run the script file called first_run.sh. This script will compile the CategoryManager.java and the Main.java

clasess at first, then it will execute the compilated files.

After this, it will be enough to run the run.sh script file called run.sh to execute the code.
